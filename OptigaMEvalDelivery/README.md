# Building and testing the OPTIGAâ„¢ Trust M for the Connected Home IP Software


This delivery provides a set of files to allow the Infineon OPTIGA M device to perfom CHIP crypto operations. The OPTIGA M device will act as a HW accelerator to the MbedTLS library.

As an example, this document will detail how to insert the files in the (now deprecated)CHIP Autotools environment. This was tested on commit 
[`3b0835852afb3a5d11e94bfc43cf2d326d379ed2`](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/3b0835852afb3a5d11e94bfc43cf2d326d379ed2) dated 25 September 2020.

The CHIP codebase is at:
 
https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip

These instructions are based on the build instructions: BUILDING.md (no longer part included in  CHIP as old automake build system is deprecated)

Firstly assemble the OPTIGA M Board on the Raspberry Pi and use the executable in the HWTest directory to check that the OPTIGA M is talking to the Raspberry Pi.

Then, to build the code:

## 1 -  Checkout the CHIP repo

```console
user@user:/home/pi$ git clone https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip
```

## 2 - Create a build directory and create a custom version (i.e. using MbedTLS rather than OpenSSL). Here we use "ifx" as the directory name as an example

```console
user@user:/home/pi$ cd connectedhomeip
user@user:/home/pi/connectedhomeip$ mkdir build/ifx
user@user:/home/pi/connectedhomeip$ cd build/ifx
user@user:/home/pi/connectedhomeip/build/ifx$ ../../configure -C --with-crypto=mbedtls
```

## 3 - Build the MbedTLS SW implementation in this build directory

```console
user@user:/home/pi/connectedhomeip/build/ifx$ ../../bootstrap
user@user:/home/pi/connectedhomeip/build/ifx$ make -C third_party/mbedtls 
```

## 4 - Run the crypto tests on the standard CHIP code with MbedTLS in SW as a sanity test

```console
user@user:/home/pi/connectedhomeip/build/ifx$ make -C src/crypto clean check
```

You should see the following summary:

```
============================================================================
# TOTAL: 1
# PASS:  1
# SKIP:  0
# XFAIL: 0
# FAIL:  0
# XPASS: 0
# ERROR: 0
============================================================================
```

If any tests fail - look at the crypto test log file

```console
user@user:/home/pi/connectedhomeip/build/ifx$ clear;cat src/crypto/tests/TestCryptoPAL.log
```

Now that the SW MbedTLS implementation is build and tested, overwrite the SW MbedTLS files with the ones to enable the OPTIGA M

## 5 - Get the OPTIGA M Files from Infineon 

```console
user@user:/home/pi/connectedhomeip/build/ifx$ cd ../../third_party/mbedtls/
user@user:/home/piconnectedhomeip//third_party/mbedtls$ git clone https://github.com/Infineon/optiga-trust-m
```

## 6 - Merge the attached files with the original files

Note that the CHIP codebase is continually changing. Any updates to these files since commit [`3b0835852afb3a5d11e94bfc43cf2d326d379ed2`](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/3b0835852afb3a5d11e94bfc43cf2d326d379ed2) dated 25 September 2020.

## 7 - Modify `optiga_lib_config.h` in `/connectedhomeip/third_party/mbedtls/optiga-trust-m/optiga/include`

```
 #define OPTIGA_COMMS_DEFAULT_RESET_TYPE     (1)
 //#define OPTIGA_COMMS_SHIELDED_CONNECTION  Disable shielded connection
```

## 8 Edit `CHIPCryptoPAL.h` to make the members of class P256Keypair public:

```cpp
public:
    P256PublicKey mPublicKey;
    P256KeypairContext mKeypair;
    bool mInitialized = false;
};
```


## 9 - Rebuild the MbedTLS SW implementation, now using the OPTIGA M

```console
user@user:/home/pi/third_party/mbedtls$ cd ../../build/ifx
user@user:/home/pi/connectedhomeip/build/ifx$ ../../bootstrap 
user@user:/home/pi/connectedhomeip/build/ifx$ make -C third_party/mbedtls clean
user@user:/home/pi/connectedhomeip/build/ifx$ make -C third_party/mbedtls 
```

## 10 - Run the crypto tests on the CHIP code with OPTIGA M 

```console
user@user:/home/pi/connectedhomeip/build/ifx$ make -C src/crypto clean check
```

**Note: For instrumenting the code there are several printfs in CHIPCryptoPALmbedTLS.cpp & ChipCryptoPALTest.cpp using the macro IFX_DBG(...) printf(__VA_ARGS__). This macro may be redefined as needed (i.e. stubbed out to supress debug messages)**


# Implementation details

The two files that really matter:

- `connectedhomeip/src/crypto/CHIPCryptoPALmbedTLS.cpp` - The main file of interest. This implements CHIP crypto by making calls to an mbedTLS library underneath. The file has been modified to allow the calls to asymmetric crypto. to be implemented by the OptigaM implementation of mbedTLS.

- `connectedhomeip/src/crypto/tests/ChipCryptoPALTest.cpp` - This file implements the crypto tests. Some tests have been modified to allow for OptigaM impelmentation. In
particular private key test vectors cannot be imported , so the tests must create the keypair on the Optiga and then export the public key from the Optiga to the test harness. As this SW is still work in progress it is necessary to make the key data public in the SW structures, as a way of getting things working in the short term with minimum complexity. In the longer term - once the SW is stable - the code should be modified to encapsulate as much key data as feasible.

However, the keys are generated purely for testing of the crypto functionality. System wide management of the keys is considered out of scope for this work. (The intention is thar this will be customer specific and should certainly be managed in detail by the customer. 

Also, there's currently no shielded connection currently in place in order to get up & running as easily as possible.
