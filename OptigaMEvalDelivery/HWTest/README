This directory contains an executable named 'trustx_chipinfo' to test that the OptigaM is connected to the RaspPi correctly.

The executable was built on a Raspberry PI 4 running Version 10 (Buster) with kernel 5.4.51-v7l+ 

When trustx_chipinfo  is run the output should be similar to the following:

./trustx_chipinfo
Read Chip Info [0xE0C2]: Success.
